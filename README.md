The table will auto-populate with the first 10 characters and their data from the API (Star Wars API was used for this app and is available [here](https://swapi.dev/)). The buttons at the bottom can be used to change pages for the populated data. Search full or partial character names using the search form at the top.

### Summary

This application is the fourth that I have created using React, and the second consuming an API for data presentation. Creating this API app was more difficult than the previous one that I created, as I had to fetch not just endpoints to display the data that I wanted, but also had to fetch additional endpoints that were part of the initially returned dataset from the root data - specifically the species and the homeworld of each character. This forced me to learn how to use and organize multiple promise calls in order to display the desired data. 

In creating this application, I learned different APIs store and present data. After creating this application, I feel confident that am able to use the returned data as well as API documentation navigate data nested in returned JSONs to fetch data for the desired display.
